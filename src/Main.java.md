## 1. Overview

This document provides internal code documentation for the Expense Tracker application.  The application utilizes Java and a graphical user interface (GUI) built with JavaFX (implied by the use of `ExpenseTrackerGUI.launch`). This document focuses on the core `Main` class and its interaction with the `ExpenseTrackerGUI` class.


## 2. Main Class

The `Main` class serves as the entry point for the Expense Tracker application. It contains a single `main` method responsible for launching the application's GUI.  The class itself is minimal, delegating all application logic to the `ExpenseTrackerGUI` class.


## 3. `main` Function

The `main` function is the application's entry point.  Its implementation is straightforward:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ExpenseTrackerGUI.launch(ExpenseTrackerGUI.class, args);
}
```

This single line of code utilizes the `launch` method of the `ExpenseTrackerGUI` class (presumably a JavaFX Application).  The `launch` method is responsible for:

* **Initialization:** Setting up the JavaFX application thread and environment.
* **GUI Creation:** Instantiating and displaying the main window of the Expense Tracker application.  The details of this window's creation and functionality are defined within the `ExpenseTrackerGUI` class (not shown here).
* **Event Handling:**  Registering event handlers to manage user interactions with the GUI (e.g., button clicks, data entry).
* **Application Lifecycle:**  Managing the lifecycle of the application, including handling shutdown events.

The `ExpenseTrackerGUI.class` argument specifies the main class of the JavaFX application, and the `args` argument provides any command-line arguments passed to the application (though none are explicitly used in this simple example).  The simplicity of the `main` method highlights the delegation of application logic to a dedicated GUI class, promoting modularity and maintainability.  Further details on the `ExpenseTrackerGUI` class and its internal workings would require examination of its source code.
